# Reflow Oven Controller
• Constructed a controller designed to operate a 1500W toaster oven via a solid state relay, and is interfaced via push buttons which start/stop reflow process and can select profile parameters (e.g., soak/reflow temperature and time).

• The controller was programmed fully in Assembly and was designed to measure and speak aloud oven temperatures between 25ᐤC and 240ᐤC, as well as being able to generate a stripchart of the temperature trend via a Python program
